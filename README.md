# *Winslette Micah B. Sanidad's Tableau Portfolio*

### Welcome to my Tableau portfolio! This repository contains samples of Tableau dashboards I've made. Feel free to take a look and reach out via email if you have any questions: *winslettemicah@gmail.com*

(Note: Best to view the dashboard in full screen.)

## [Project 1: World Happiness Report 2015-2019](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/winslette.micah.sanidad/viz/WorldHappinessReport_16926190630610/WorldHappinessReport2015-2019?publish=yes)

This is a project I did under my certification of Break Into Tech.
In this project, I tried to show the Happiness Score and other factors that affect the rankings and score of each country over the course of 5 years in which researchers can use to identify such changes. I also showed the Happiest and Least Happiest Countries each year. (Data was taken from Kaggle.)

## [Project 2: Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/winslette.micah.sanidad/viz/Netflix_16933255513220/Netflix?publish=yes)

This is a project I saw on Youtube and tried to follow along with it to further enhance and practice my skills in Tableau.
The Netflix project shows the details about the Movies and TV Shows added from 2008-2020.

## [Project 3: Executive Overview](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/winslette.micah.sanidad/viz/ExecutiveOverview_16918103976260/ExecutiveOverview?publish=yes)

This is a little more advanced and really cool dashboard I made by taking the Tableau Creator training. The project showed the sales of a company in USA.

## [Project 4: February - Product Sales Report](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/winslette.micah.sanidad/viz/February-ProductSalesReport/February-ProductSalesReport?publish=yes)

The project shows the product sales report of a company in the month of February. It also showed which city has the most ordered products, sales revenue by city, products ordered per day, and sales revenue by product.

## [Project 5: World COVID Data](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/winslette.micah.sanidad/viz/WorldCOVIDData_16916776231150/WorldCovidData?publish=yes)

This is the first Tableau project I did while taking the certification by Break Into Tech. The dashboard shows the vaccination rates of the different regions and countries in the world. It also showed the vaccination rates of each of the different income groups.
